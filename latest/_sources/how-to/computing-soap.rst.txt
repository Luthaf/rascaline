Computing SOAP features
=======================

This examples shows how to compute the SOAP power spectrum descriptor for each
atom in each system of a provided systems file. The path to the systems file is
taken from the first command line argument.

In the end, the descriptor is transformed in a way compatible with how most
classic machine learning (such as PCA or linear regression) work.

The workflow is the same for every provided descriptor. Take a look at the
:ref:`userdoc-references` for a list with all descriptors and their specific
parameters.

You can obtain a testing dataset from our :download:`website <../../static/dataset.xyz>`.
