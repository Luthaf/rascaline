density when computing density-based representations, such as SOAP or LODE.

# For this example, we will define a new custom radial basis for the SOAP spherical
# expansion, based on Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind. This basis will then be
# used in combination with spherical harmonics to expand the density of neighboring
# atoms around a central atom.
#
# In featomic, defining custom radial basis is done by creating a class inheriting from
# :py:class:`featomic.basis.RadialBasis`, and implementing the required method. The
# main one is ``compute_primitive``, which evaluates the radial basis on a set of
# points. This function should also be able to evaluate the derivative of the radial
# basis. If needed :py:meth:`featomic.basis.RadialBasis.finite_differences_derivative`
# can be used to compute the derivative with finite differences.

#
# Since the calculation of the splines requires computing some integral numerically, the
# creation of the splines might take a while. After an initial calculation, you can save
# the splines data in JSON files; and then reload them later to re-use:

# convert the hypers from classes to a pure JSON-compatible dictionary
json_hypers = featomic.hypers_to_json(hypers)

# save the data to a file
with open("splined-hypers.json", "w") as fp:
    json.dump(json_hypers, fp)


# load the data from the file
with open("splined-hypers.json", "r") as fp:
    json_hypers = json.load(fp)

# the hypers can be used directly with the calculators
calculator = featomic.SphericalExpansion(**json_hypers)


# %%
#
# Finally, you can use the same method to define custom
# :py:class:`featomic.basis.ExpansionBasis` and custom
# :py:class:`featomic.density.AtomicDensity`; by creating a new class inheriting from
# the corresponding base class and implementing the corresponding methods. This allow
# you to create a fully custom spherical expansion, and evaluate them efficiently
# through the splines.
